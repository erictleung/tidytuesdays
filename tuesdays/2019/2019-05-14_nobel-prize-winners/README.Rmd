## Introduction

> "We constructed the publication records for almost all Nobel laureates in
> physics, chemistry, and physiology or medicine from 1900 to 2016 (545 out of
> 590, 92.4%). We first collected information manually from Nobel Prize
> official websites, their university websites, and Wikipedia. We then match it
> algorithmically with big data, tracing publication records from the MAG
> database."
